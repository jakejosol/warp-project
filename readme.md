#**WARP Framework**#

WARP (Web Apps Ready-to-Publish) is a PHP framework for creating API-based, Design-centered and Controls-extensible applications. Its main
mission is to make it easier for Design-Developers to create frontend pages entirely in HTML5, and manage backend services with PHP. This
keeps the design layer entirely free from complicated server scripts and shifts its focus ultimately on the modern web languages.
